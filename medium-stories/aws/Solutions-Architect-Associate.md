# How I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Exam
## About me
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than 10 years of practice. I have a great passion for sharing my experiences. That's why over the past 5 years, I've been mentoring young Java developers through [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/). I successfully helped more than 30 newcomers in IT to become **professional Java developers**.

## Why I wanted to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Exam
I decided to tackle the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Exam to validate my skills in Cloud Computing. Since I didn't have real-life experience in cloud solutions, I wanted something that would allow me to illustrate my cloud skills.

## How I prepared for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Exam
In the beginning, I trained by using tutorials from the internet. After nearly a year, I realized I wasn't moving how I wanted. So I decided to purchase a course from Udemy. I followed that course for something like 6 months, but still, I wasn't moving at the speed I expected. What really pushed me up was when I decided to purchase the exam at AWS Training. From that time, I knew I had no choice but to prepare for the exam. From the time I purchased the exam, it took me less than a month to pass the exam. I scored 80.1%.

## Challenges I faced
The hardest thing about this exam is that there are a lot of topics to cover and the exam questions are really tricky. So you need to be really meticulous. However, if you practice while learning it'll really help you to master.

## Key takeaways
Of course, what I enjoyed the most was when I received my exam report and realized I passed. Apart from that I really liked the atmosphere of the exam. It was indeed the first exam that I took entirely online.

## Tips and advice
My advice if you have this kind of project is to set a target before even starting the process. You can say something like in 3 months, I have to pass the exam. Then make sure, you actually purchase the exam. This way, you'll be forced to do what it takes to get ready.

## Final thoughts and next steps
My next learning goal is to get deeper into AWS by taking the AWS Certified Developer exam. I'm planning to take it in the first quarter of 2024.
